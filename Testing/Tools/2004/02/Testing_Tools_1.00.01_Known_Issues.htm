        <DT>Description 
        <DD>There are some cases in which an encoding specified in the XML 
        declaration of a WSDL or schema document will be recognized by one 
        analyzer, but not by the other. For example, the encoding cp125 is not 
        recognized by the C# analyzer but will be accepted by the Java analyzer. 
        In this case the C# analyzer will fail more assertions than the Java 
        analyzer (however, the Java analyzer will fail assertion WSI2201). An 
        analogous situation would occur in the case where the C# analyzer 
        recognized an encoding but the Java analyzer did not. 
        <DT class=resolution>Resolution: 2003-10-16 
        <DD class=resolution>
        <P>Severity: low. This problem does not affect the consistency of the 
        final reports: the material under test will fail to conform with both 
        tools, just in different ways. An encoding problem will cause an XML 
        parsing error, which in turns prevents the Analyzer to complete its 
        analysis. In such a case, users should consider the possibility of an 
        encoding failure.</P></DD></DL></TD></TR></TBODY>

        <DT>Description 
        <DD>There is one portion of the WSI1011 and WSI1013 test assertions that 
        is not implemented in the Java analyzer. The Java analyzer does not 
        schema validate the contents of a SOAP message when processing these 
        test assertions. This means that the Java analyzer may return a passed 
        result instead of a failed result when the message content does not 
        match the schema definition. 
        <DT class=resolution>Resolution: 2003-10-23 
        <DD class=resolution>
        <P>Severity: medium. This problem will result in Java reports that are 
        overly optimistic. Note however, apart from schema-validation all the 
        remaining correlation cross-checking between a wsdl document and 
        candidate message is done without using the schema validator. Next tool 
        release will address this problem. </P></DD></DL></TD></TR></TBODY>

        <DD>C# analyzer may return fail (and its dependant assertions to return 
        results of notAapplicable), in cases where the Java analyzer returns a 
        pass. This occurs because the code in C# analyzer which validates schema 
        against the XML schema for schemas will generate an error if the schema 
        being validated contains a reference to an undefined complex type.

        <DT>Description 
        <DD>When processing test assertion WSI2122, the C# analyzer actually 
        schema validates the data type definitions within the WSDL document, 
        while the Java analyzer validates them against the schema for XML 
        Schemas (XML Schema 1.0 Recommendation with namespace 
        "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"). This means that the Java analyzer, 
        because it does not fully check the data type definitions themselves, 
        may return a passed result even though these definitions may be invalid.
