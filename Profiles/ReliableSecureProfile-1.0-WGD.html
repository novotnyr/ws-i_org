		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>This
document defines the WS-I Reliable Secure Profile 1.0 (hereafter,
"Profile"), consisting of a set of non-proprietary Web services
specifications, along with clarifications, refinements, interpretations
and amplifications of those specifications which promote
interoperability.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>Section 1 introduces the Profile, and explains its relationships to other profiles.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>Section 2, "Profile Conformance," explains what it means to be conformant to the Profile. </p>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>Each
subsequent section addresses a component of the Profile, and consists
of two parts; an overview detailing the component specifications and

individual parts of the component specifications. Note that there is no
relationship between the section numbers in this document and those in
the referenced specifications.</p>
		<h3 id="relationships">1.1 Relationships to Other Profiles</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>This
Profile is intended to be composed with the WS-I Basic Profile 1.2,
WS-I Basic Profile 2.0, WS-I Basic Security Profile 1.0 and WS-I Basic
Security Profile 1.1. Composability of RSP with the previously
mentioned profiles offers the following guarantee to users: conformance
of an artifact to RSP does not prevent conformance of this artifact to
these other profiles, and vice-versa.</p>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>Because
the conformance targets defined for RSP may not match exactly the
conformance targets for another profile, the following more precise
definition of composability is assumed in this profile:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>
				<em>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>A
profile P2 is said to be composable with a profile P1 if, for any
respective pair of conformance targets (T2, T1) where T1 depends on T2
(see definition below), conformance of an instance of T2 to P2 does not
prevent conformance of the related T1 instance(s) to P1, and vice-versa
in case T2 depends on T1.</em>
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>A target T1  is said to  depend on a target T2  if either:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>T2 and T1 are just different names for the same type of artifact (e.g. ENVELOPE in RSP and SOAP_ENVELOPE in BSP)</li>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>or T2 is a specialization (or particular instance) of T1 (e.g. SECURE_ENVELOPE in BSP is a specialization of ENVELOPE in RSP)</li>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>T2 is contained in T1 (e.g. SECURITY_HEADER in BSP is contained in ENVELOPE in RSP)</li>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>more
generally, an instance of T2 will restrict in some way the possible
values - or behaviors - of T1 instances associated with it.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>In order to conform to this profile (RSP):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>If SOAP 1.1 is being used, all requirements defined in BP 1.2 must be complied with.</li>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>If SOAP 1.2 is being used, all requirements defined in BP 2.0 must be complied with.</li>
			<li>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Implementations
must conform to the WS-Addressing 1.0 - Core and SOAP Binding
specifications, and if WSDL is used, the WS-Addressing 1.0 - Metadata
specification.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="philosophy">1.2 Guiding Principles</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>The
Profile was developed according to a set of principles that, together,
form the philosophy of the Profile, as it relates to bringing about
interoperability. This section documents these guidelines.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>No guarantee of interoperability</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>It
is impossible to completely guarantee the interoperability of a
particular service. However, the Profile does address the most common
problems that implementation experience has revealed to date.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Application semantics</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Although
communication of application semantics can be facilitated by the
technologies that comprise the Profile, assuring the common
understanding of those semantics is not addressed by it.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Testability</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>When
possible, the Profile makes statements that are testable. However, such
testability is not required. Preferably, testing is achieved in a
non-intrusive manner (e.g., examining artifacts "on the wire"). </dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Strength of requirements</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>The
Profile makes strong requirements (e.g., MUST, MUST NOT) wherever
feasible; if there are legitimate cases where such a requirement cannot
be met, conditional requirements (e.g., SHOULD, SHOULD NOT) are used.
Optional and conditional requirements introduce ambiguity and
mismatches between implementations.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Restriction vs. relaxation</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>When
amplifying the requirements of referenced specifications, the Profile
may restrict them, but does not relax them (e.g., change a MUST to a
MAY).</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Multiple mechanisms</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>If
a referenced specification allows multiple mechanisms to be used
interchangeably, the Profile selects those that are well-understood,
widely implemented and useful. Extraneous or underspecified mechanisms
and extensions introduce complexity and therefore reduce
interoperability.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Future compatibility</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>When
possible, the Profile aligns its requirements with in-progress
revisions to the specifications it references. This aids implementers
by enabling a graceful transition, and assures that WS-I does not
'fork' from these efforts. When the Profile cannot address an issue in
a specification it references, this information is communicated to the
appropriate body to assure its consideration.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Compatibility with deployed services</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Backwards
compatibility with deployed Web services is not a goal for the Profile,
but due consideration is given to it; the Profile does not introduce a
change to the requirements of a referenced specification unless doing
so addresses specific interoperability issues.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Focus on interoperability</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Although
there are potentially a number of inconsistencies and design flaws in
the referenced specifications, the Profile only addresses those that
affect interoperability.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Conformance targets</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Where
possible, the Profile places requirements on artifacts (e.g., WSDL
descriptions, SOAP messages) rather than the producing or consuming
software's behaviors or roles. Artifacts are concrete, making them
easier to verify and therefore making conformance easier to understand
and less error-prone.</dd>
			<dt>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>Lower-layer interoperability</dt>
			<dd>
				<span class="statement-target"></span>The
Profile speaks to interoperability at the application layer; it assumes
that interoperability of lower-layer protocols (e.g., TCP, IP,
Ethernet) is adequate and well-understood. Similarly, statements about
application-layer substrate protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS, HTTP) are only
made when there is an issue affecting Web services specifically; WS-I
does not attempt to assure the interoperability of these protocols as a
whole. This assures that WS-I's expertise in and focus on Web services
standards is used effectively.</dd>

		<h3 id="tassertions">1.3 Test Assertions</h3>
		<p>
			<span class="statement-target"></span>
            This profile document contains embedded Test Assertions (TA) that are associated with 
	    each normative profile requirement. In the HTML rendering of this document, 
	    these test assertions are accessible via a toggle link at the end of each requirement. 
	    When clicking on such a link, a table pops up that displays the TA parts. 
	    At the end of this table is another toggle link ("help-glossary") that displays an
	    explanation glossary for the TA structure.
	    In other formats of this document, the test assertions are grouped in an appendix
	    not controlled by any link, in order to facilitate the printing of hard copies.
	    The resulting set of test assertions embedded in this document represents 
	    a conformance test suite for the profile.

The test assertions are scripted using XPath2.0 and are automatically
processable using the version 2.0 of the WS-I Analyzer tools. Several
requirements have been tagged "NOT TESTABLE" or "NOT TESTABLE XPATH".
This means that these requirements cannot be tested based on the
technology choices (black-box testing, XPath scripting). Other
requirements have been tagged "NOT TESTED". This is the case for most
optional requirements (SHOULD, MAY), and for most Extensibility points.
A subsequent version may cover those requirements. In this profile, the
core requirements for assessing interoperability of implementations
have been initially targeted. </td>

		<h3 id="conventions">1.4 
            Notational Conventions
        </h3>
		<p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in 
			<a class="offsite" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>.</p>
		<p>Normative statements of requirements in the Profile (i.e., those
        impacting conformance, as outlined in "
			<a href="#conformance_requirements">Conformance Requirements</a>") are
        presented in the following manner:</p>
		<p class="statement">
			<span class="statement-id">Rnnnn</span>Statement
        text here.</p>
		<p>where "nnnn" is replaced by a number that is unique among the
        requirements in the Profile, thereby forming a unique requirement
        identifier.</p>
		<p>Requirement identifiers can be considered to be namespace
        qualified, in such a way as to be compatible with QNames from 
			<a class="offsite" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a>. If
        there is no explicit namespace prefix on a requirement's identifier
        (e.g., "R9999" as opposed to "bp10:R9999"), it should be interpreted
        as being in the namespace identified by the conformance URI of the
        document section it occurs in. If it is qualified, the prefix should
        be interpreted according to the namespace mappings in effect, as
        documented below.</p>
		<p>Some requirements clarify the referenced specification(s), but do not
        place additional constraints upon implementations. For convenience,
        clarifications are annotated in the following manner: 
			<span class="statement-type">C</span>
		</p>
		<p>Some requirements are derived from ongoing standardization work on
        the referenced specification(s). For convenience, such forward-derived
        statements are annotated in the following manner: 
			<span class="statement-origin">xxxx</span>, where "xxxx" is an identifier
        for the specification (e.g., "WSDL20" for WSDL Version 2.0). Note that
        because such work was not complete when this document was published,
        the specification that the requirement is derived from may change;
        this information is included only as a convenience to
        implementers.</p>
		<p>As noted above, some requirements may present compatibility issues
		(whether forwards or backwards) with previously published versions of the
		profile.  For convenience, such requirements are annotated in the following
		manner: 
			<span class="compat-type">Compat</span>
		</p>
		<p>Extensibility points in underlying specifications (see "
			<a href="#conformance_scope">Conformance Scope</a>") are presented in a similar
        manner:</p>
		<p class="statement">
			<span class="statement-id">Ennnn</span>Extensibility
        Point Name - Description</p>
		<p>where "nnnn" is replaced by a number that is unique among the extensibility
        points in the Profile. As with requirement statements, extensibility statements
        can be considered namespace-qualified.</p>
		<p>This specification uses a number of namespace prefixes throughout;
            their associated URIs are listed below. Note that the choice of any
            namespace prefix is arbitrary and not semantically significant.</p>

        Profile Identification and Versioning
        </h3>
		<p>This document is identified by a name (in this case, Reliable Secure Profile) and
        a version number (here, 1.0). Together, they identify a
        particular 
			<em>profile instance</em>.</p>
		<p>Version numbers are composed of a major and minor portion, in the form
        "major.minor". They can be used to determine the precedence of a
        profile instance; a higher version number (considering both the major
        and minor components) indicates that an instance is more recent, and
        therefore supersedes earlier instances.</p>
		<p>Instances of profiles with the same name (e.g., "Example
        Profile 1.1" and "Example Profile 5.0") address interoperability
        problems in the same general scope (although some developments may
        require the exact scope of a profile to change between instances).</p>
		<p>One can also use this information to determine whether two instances of
        a profile are backwards-compatible; that is, whether one can assume
        that conformance to an earlier profile instance implies conformance to a later
        one. Profile instances with the same name and major version number (e.g.,
        "Example Profile 1.0" and "Example Profile 1.1") MAY be considered
        compatible. Note that this does not imply anything about compatibility
        in the other direction; that is, one cannot assume that conformance
        with a later profile instance implies conformance to an earlier one.</p>
		<h2 id="conformance">2 
            Profile Conformance
        </h2>
		<p>Conformance to the Profile is defined by adherence to the
        set of 
			<em>requirements</em> defined for a specific
        
			<em>target</em>, within the 
			<em>scope</em> of the
        Profile. This section explains these terms and describes how
        conformance is defined and used.</p>
		<h3 id="conformance_requirements">2.1
             
            Conformance Requirements
        </h3>
		<p>Requirements state the criteria for conformance to the
        Profile. They typically refer to an existing specification and
        embody refinements, amplifications, interpretations and
        clarifications to it in order to improve interoperability. All
        requirements in the Profile are considered normative, and those
        in the specifications it references that are in-scope (see
        "Conformance Scope") should likewise be considered normative.
        When requirements in the Profile and its referenced
        specifications contradict each other, the Profile's
        requirements take precedence for purposes of Profile
        conformance.</p>
		<p>Requirement levels, using 
			<a class="offsite" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a> language (e.g.,
        MUST, MAY, SHOULD) indicate the nature of the requirement and its
        impact on conformance. Each requirement is individually identified
        (e.g., R9999) for convenience.</p>
		<p>For example;</p>
		<p class="statement">
			<span class="statement-id">R9999</span> Any 
			<strong>WIDGET</strong> SHOULD be round in shape.</p>
		<p>This requirement is identified by "R9999", applies to the
        target WIDGET (see below), and places a conditional
        requirement upon widgets; i.e., although this requirement must
        be met to maintain conformance in most cases, there are some
        situations where there may be valid reasons for it not being
        met (which are explained in the requirement itself, or in its
        accompanying text).</p>
		<p>Each requirement statement contains exactly one requirement level
        keyword (e.g., "MUST") and one conformance target keyword (e.g.,
        "MESSAGE"). The conformance target keyword appears in bold text (e.g. "
			<b>MESSAGE</b>").
Other conformance targets appearing in non-bold text are being used
strictly for their definition and NOT as a conformance target.
Additional text may be included to illuminate a requirement or group of
requirements (e.g., rationale and examples); however, prose surrounding
requirement statements must not be considered in determining
conformance.</p>
		<p>Definitions of terms in the Profile are considered
        authoritative for the purposes of determining
        conformance.</p>
		<p>None of the requirements in the Profile, regardless of
        their conformance level, should be interpreted as limiting the
        ability of an otherwise conforming implementation to apply
        security countermeasures in response to a real or perceived
        threat (e.g., a denial of service attack).</p>
		<h3 id="conformance_targets">2.2
             
            Conformance Targets
	    </h3>
		<p>Conformance targets identify what artifacts (e.g.,
        SOAP message, WSDL description, UDDI registry data) or
        parties (e.g., SOAP processor, end user) requirements
        apply to. </p>
		<p>This allows for the definition of conformance in
        different contexts, to assure unambiguous interpretation
        of the applicability of requirements, and to allow
        conformance testing of artifacts (e.g., SOAP messages and
        WSDL descriptions) and the behavior of various parties to
        a Web service (e.g., clients and service instances).</p>
		<p>Requirements' conformance targets are physical
        artifacts wherever possible, to simplify testing and avoid
        ambiguity.</p>
		<p>The following conformance targets are used in the Profile:</p>
		<ul>

            Conformance Scope
        </h3>
		<p>The scope of the Profile delineates the technologies
        that it addresses; in other words, the Profile only attempts
        to improve interoperability within its own scope.
        Generally, the Profile's scope is bounded by the
        specifications referenced by it.</p>
		<p>The Profile's scope is further refined by extensibility
        points. Referenced specifications often provide extension
        mechanisms and unspecified or open-ended configuration
        parameters; when identified in the Profile as an
        extensibility point, such a mechanism or parameter is
        outside the scope of the Profile, and its use or non-use
        is not relevant to conformance.</p>
		<p>Note that the Profile may still place requirements on
        the use of an extensibility point. Also, specific uses of
        extensibility points may be further restricted by other
        profiles, to improve interoperability when used in
        conjunction with the Profile.</p>
		<p>Because the use of extensibility points may impair
        interoperability, their use should be negotiated or
        documented in some fashion by the parties to a Web
        service; for example, this could take the form of an
        out-of-band agreement.</p>
		<p>The Profile's scope is defined by the referenced
        specifications in 
			<a href="#references">Appendix A</a>,  as refined by the
        extensibility points in 
			<a href="#points">Appendix B</a>.</p>

Test Assertion IDs. Each one of the prerequisite TAs must either use
the same target (e.g. SOAP Envelope, or WSDL binding, etc.) as this TA,
or a target that is of a more general type than the main TA target. The

undetermined} (default is 'failed') The reported outcomes have the
following meaning:passed: the target passes the test and can be
considered as fulfilling the profile feature.failed: the target fails
the test and can be considered as violating (or not exhibiting) the
profile feature.warning: the test result is inconclusive. There is a
possibility of profile requirement violation, that deserved further
investigation.undetermined: the test result is inconclusive for this
predicate value.NOTES: the predicate of the TA may be worded in a
negative way so that @false='passed' although that is not recommended.
The result of a test should not be related to the prescription level,
e.g. a "preferred" or "permitted" level should not imply that
@false='warning'.Other test results that are automatically generated
and not controlled by the "reporting" element are:notRelevant: the
target failed the prerequisite condition and therefore does not qualify
for further testing (i.e. the predicate expression is NOT evaluated on
it).missingInput: a cotarget expression returned an empty node

			<div class="rationale">
				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>For
messages that flow from the RMS to the RMD, the version(s) of SOAP used
for Sequence Lifecycle Messages are constrained to the version(s) of
SOAP that are supported by the target endpoint (i.e. the endpoint to
which the client is attempting to reliably communicate). For example,
if a client is attempting to communicate reliably to an endpoint who's
service description indicates that it only supports SOAP 1.1, the RMS
should only send Sequence Lifecycle Messages using SOAP 1.1. Sequence
Lifecycle Response Messages (CreateSequenceResponse,
TerminateSequenceResponse, and CloseSequenceResponse) should use the
version of SOAP used by their corresponding request message
(CreateSequence, TerminateSequence, and CloseSequence respectively);
this applies to WS-RM fault messages as well. For messages that flow
from the RMD to the RMS (SequenceAck messages with an empty body,
unsolicited CloseSequence messages, and unsolicited TerminateSequence
messages) this profile adheres to and expands upon WS-RM's statement
that "The SOAP version used for the CreateSequence message SHOULD be
used for all subsequent messages in or for that Sequence, sent by

				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>The
use of the Offer element within a CreateSequence message is an optional
feature of WS-ReliableMessaging. Using Offer avoids the exchange of
CreateSequence and CreateSequenceResponse messages to establish a new
sequence for response messages. However, WS-RM does not define a
mechanism by which an RMS can determine if an Offer is desired by the
RMD. This creates a potential interoperability issue in cases where an
RMS that either doesn't wish to use or cannot support the use of Offer
attempts to create a Sequence with an RMD that requires the use of
Offer. To ensure interoperability, the Offer feature must be optional
for both the initiator of the Sequence (the RMS) as well as the RMD.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>Conversely,
when an RMS includes an Offer within a CreateSeqence and the RMD
rejects that Offer (e.g. if it only has input-only operations and
concludes it has no need for the offered Sequence), if the RMD
indicates this choice by faulting the CreateSequence the RMS has no
programmatic means of determining that the fault was due to the
presence of an Offer. To ensure interoperatbility in these cases, the
RMD, rather than faulting the CreateSequence, must instead simply not
accept the offered Sequence by not including an Accept element in the
CreateSequenceResponse.</p>

			<span class="statement-target"></span>WS-ReliableMessaging
allows for the addition of some WS-RM-defined headers to messages that

				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>Because
there is no standard mechanism for comparing EPRs, it is possible for
different implementations to have dissimilar assumptions about which
messages are and are not valid carriers for piggybacked
SequenceAcknowledgement headers. For example, an implementation of the
RMS may assume that the ReferenceParameters (if any) of the EPRs will
be compared as part of the determination of whether a message is
targeted to "the same" endpoint as the AcksTo endpoint. Meanwhile an
implementation of the RMD may assume that a simple comparison of the
Address IRIs is sufficient for making this determination. This creates
the possibility for misdirected, dropped, and otherwise lost
acknowledgements to the detriment and possible malfunctioning of the
WS-RM protocol.</p>

							<td>General Notes:</td>
							<td>Section
3.9 of WS-RM says that, when AcksTo is anonymous, the only way to
transmit acknowledgments is over the back-channel created by an STM
that is within the sequence to which the ack applies. The text in WS-RM
applies to all acknowledgements. This requirement highlights
piggybacked acknowledgments as a special case of this general rule.
Crafting an assertion that checks for violation of this requirement
should be fairly straightforward. However, to have any meaningful
coverage, we need test scenarios that create an environment capable of
stimulating the incorrect behavior. Essentially we need scenarios in
which a single client/RMS creates two or more sequences with a single
server/RMS using anonymous AcksTos in all the sequences and sends a
either a series of one-way message or a series of request-response
messages. To keep things simple, this later variation should not
include reliability for the response messages</td>

					<span class="statement-target"></span>The
term "differentiate" in the above requirement refers to the process of
altering the information in the EPR in such a way as to cause the RMD
to rule out the possibility of piggybacking acknowledgments for these
Sequences while preserving the RMDs ability to connect to the proper
transport endpoint. For example, suppose a particular instance of a web
services stack maintains a generic, asynchronous callback facility at
http://b2b.foo.com/async/AsyncResponseService. In general, all the EPRs
minted by this instance for the purpose of servicing callbacks will
have this URI as the value of their wsa:Address element. However, if
this web services stack does not support the processing piggybacked
acknowledgements, the use this value in the AcksTo EPR creates the
potential for the problem described above. The RMS implementation of
this web services stack could fulfill this requirement by specifying
http://b2b.foo.com/async/AsyncResponseService?p={ <em>
						<span class="statement-target"></span>unique value</em>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>}
as the address of the AcksTo EPR for any sequences it creates. Since
each sequence has a "different" AcksTo EPR (as defined by R0500) from
all the other services listening for callbacks, no RSP 1.0 compliant
RMD will piggyback acknowledgements for these sequences, though each
RMD (in the case of SOAP/HTTP) will correctly connect to
http://b2b.foo.com and POST to /async/AsyncResponseService.</p>

Test Assertion IDs. Each one of the prerequisite TAs must either use

7 of the WS-SecureConversation specification describes a mechanism for
using keys derived from a shared secret for signing and encrypting the

					<span class="statement-target"></span> element is used to express these derived keys. WS-SC states that the

Test Assertion IDs. Each one of the prerequisite TAs must either use

the test and can be considered as violating (or not exhibiting) the
profile feature.warning: the test result is inconclusive. There is a
possibility of profile requirement violation, that deserved further
investigation.undetermined: the test result is inconclusive for this
predicate value.NOTES: the predicate of the TA may be worded in a
negative way so that @false='passed' although that is not recommended.
The result of a test should not be related to the prescription level,
e.g. a "preferred" or "permitted" level should not imply that
@false='warning'.Other test results that are automatically generated
and not controlled by the "reporting" element are:notRelevant: the
target failed the prerequisite condition and therefore does not qualify
for further testing (i.e. the predicate expression is NOT evaluated on
it).missingInput: a cotarget expression returned an empty node

					<span class="statement-target"></span>A non-addressable endpoint may use wsmc:MakeConnection in a SOAP envelope to obtain any pending messages from an endpoint.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>The
MakeConnection specification does not mandate how long an MCReceiver
needs to wait for an outgoing message to be generated - this is left as
an implementation choice. For example, in some environments if there is
no message ready to be sent back to the MCSender then returning an HTTP
202 immediately might be appropriate, while in some other cases waiting
a certain period of time might improve performance with respect to
network traffic. Either case could occur.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>When
the SOAP request-response MEP is in use and the client is
non-addressable the general rules for binding SOAP envelopes to HTTP
requests messages (as described by the Basic Profile) apply. SOAP
envelopes, that are described by the input message of the WSDL
operations supported by a service, are bound to HTTP request messages.
SOAP envelopes, that are described by the output message of the WSDL
operations supported by a service, are bound to HTTP response messages.
For non-addressable services the situation is reversed; the SOAP
envelopes, that are described by the input message of the WSDL
operations supported by the service, are bound to HTTP <strong>
						<span class="statement-target"></span>response</strong>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>
messages and SOAP envelopes, that are described by the output message
of the WSDL operations supported by the service, are bound to HTTP <strong>
						<span class="statement-target"></span>request</strong>
					<span class="statement-target"></span> messages.</p>

			<span class="statement-target"></span>In
section 3.1 of the WS-MakeConnection specification the WS-MC Anonymous
URI is defined to uniquely identity anonymous endpoints and to signal
the intention to use the MakeConnection protocol to transfer messages
between the endpoints. The WS-MakeConnection protocol uses the receipt
of the MakeConnection message at an endpoint as the mechanism by which
the back-channel of that connection can be uniquely identified. Once
identified, the MC Receiver is then free to use that back-channel to
send any pending message targeted to the URI specified within the
MakeConnection message.</p>

			<h4 id="Addressing_Variants">5.2.1 Addressing Variants</h4>
			<div class="rationale">
				<p>
					<span class="statement-target"></span>The
WS-MakeConnection specification defines two distinct ways for the
MC-Sender to indicate its messages of interest. One of these mechanisms
uses the wsmc:MakeConnection Anonymous URI, the other uses a WS-RM
Sequence ID. However, the WS-MakeConnection specification doesn't
define any way of advertising or agreeing upon which variant of the
MakeConnection protocol is supported or required by an endpoint. This
creates the potential for different, incompatible implementations of
WS-MakeConnection. To promote interoperability this Profile refines the
WS-MakeConnection specification with additional requirements to mandate
the use of a single, consistent addressing variant. Since the URI
variant of WS-MakeConnection is a superset of the functionality of the
Sequence-ID variant, use of the URI variant is mandated by this Profile.</p>

5.2.2.1 of the WS-ReliableMessaging specification states that "During
the CreateSequence exchange, the RM Source SHOULD explicitly identify

leaves open the possibility for RMS implementations that, for some
reason, attempt to use WS-SC to secure their Sequences in some manner
that does not explicitly identify the security context that will be
used to protect the Sequence (e.g. by some out of band understanding of
an inferred security context). This possibility creates an obvious
operational and interoperability issues since (a) point-to-point,
out-of-band configuration creates unscalable operational overhead and

not qualify for this Test Assertion (the test report is
"notRelevant")The first part (preReq attribute) is an enumeration of
Test Assertion IDs. Each one of the prerequisite TAs must either use
the same target (e.g. SOAP Envelope, or WSDL binding, etc.) as this TA,
or a target that is of a more general type than the main TA target. The
target must "pass" each one of these prerequisite TAs in order to
qualify for this TA.(e.g. the target of TA t1 can be a WSDL binding
while the target of a TA t2 prerequisite of t1, can be the entire WSDL
file).The second part ("prerequisite" element) is an XPath (boolean)
expression of the same nature as the predicate. If present, it must
evaluate to "true" for the target to qualify. If it fails, the result
for the current TA in the report will be "notRelevant". Otherwise, the

a security standpoint, it will be commonly desired that the security
context of the message sent on the backchannel established by a
MakeConnection and that of the MakeConnection message itself be the
same. However, it is important to keep in mind that the
WS-MakeConnection protocol is independent of the application
protocol(s) flowing over it, thus there will be cases in which the
MC-SENDER has no knowledge of the security context (if any) of the
backchannel messages. For example, the WS-MakeConnection specification
details a scenario in which MakeConnection is used to deliver
Notifications from an Event Source. The Event Source may have a variety
of different security contexts that it uses depending on the type of
Notification being delivered. In this case the MC-SENDER has no way of
knowing which security context, if any, should to be used. In such
situations, the MC-RECEIVER needs to simply ensure that the MC-SENDER
is authenticated. It would still be the MC-SENDER's responsibility to
ensure that any message sent on the backchannel has the correct
security context - just as would any endpoint receiving a message over
a new connection.</p>

not qualify for this Test Assertion (the test report is
"notRelevant")The first part (preReq attribute) is an enumeration of
Test Assertion IDs. Each one of the prerequisite TAs must either use
the same target (e.g. SOAP Envelope, or WSDL binding, etc.) as this TA,
or a target that is of a more general type than the main TA target. The
target must "pass" each one of these prerequisite TAs in order to
qualify for this TA.(e.g. the target of TA t1 can be a WSDL binding
while the target of a TA t2 prerequisite of t1, can be the entire WSDL
file).The second part ("prerequisite" element) is an XPath (boolean)
expression of the same nature as the predicate. If present, it must
evaluate to "true" for the target to qualify. If it fails, the result
for the current TA in the report will be "notRelevant". Otherwise, the

of violation. As a result, when "true" indicates fulfillment it may be
that "false" is unconclusive, or conversely "false" will indicate
violation, but "true" is unconclusive. In such cases, the "Reporting"

the test and can be considered as violating (or not exhibiting) the

negative way so that @false='passed' although that is not recommended.
The result of a test should not be related to the prescription level,
e.g. a "preferred" or "permitted" level should not imply that
@false='warning'.Other test results that are automatically generated

target failed the prerequisite condition and therefore does not qualify
