    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>This document defines the WS-I SAML Token Profile 1.0 (hereafter, &quot;Profile&quot;), consisting of a set of non-proprietary Web services 
                specifications, along with clarifications to and amplifications of those specifications which promote interoperability.</p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>Section 1, <em><span class="statement-target"></span>&quot;Introduction,&quot;</em><span class="statement-target"></span> introduces the Profile and describes its relationship to other, existing profiles.</p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>Section 2, <em><span class="statement-target"></span>&quot;Document Conventions,&quot;</em><span class="statement-target"></span> describes notational conventions utilized by this Profile.</p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>Section 3, <em><span class="statement-target"></span>&quot;Profile Conformance,&quot;</em><span class="statement-target"></span> explains what it means to be conformant to the Profile. </p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>Each subsequent section addresses a component of the Profile, and consists of two parts: 
                an overview detailing the component specifications and their extensibility points, followed by subsections 
                that address individual parts of the component specifications. Note that there is no relationship between the section numbers
                in this document and those in the referenced specifications.</p>
    <h3 id="relationship">1.1 Relationship to other Profiles</h3>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>This Profile adds an additional security token type for use with Basic Security Profile 1.0.</p>
    <h2 id="documentConventions">2. Document Conventions</h2>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>This document follows conventions common to all WS-I profiles. These are described in the following sections. </p>
    <h3 id="SecurityConsiderations">2.1 Security Considerations</h3>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>The Profile will draw attention to security considerations; however, these are informational only and should be treated as non-normative. 
		   Adherence to these considerations does not guarantee security.</p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span> Security considerations are presented as follows:</p>
    <p class="statement">
      <span class="statement-id"><span class="statement-target"></span>Cnnnn</span><span class="statement-target"></span> Statement text here.
		  </p>
    <p><span class="statement-target"></span>where &quot;nnnn&quot; is replaced by a number that is unique among the
                       considerations in the Profile, thereby forming a unique consideration
                       identifier.</p>
    <h3 id="conventions">2.2 
            Notational Conventions
        </h3>
    <p>The keywords &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
        &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <a class="offsite" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a>.</p>
    <p>Normative statements of requirements in 
		  the Profile
		 (i.e., those
        impacting conformance, as outlined in &quot;<a href="#conformance_requirements">Conformance Requirements</a>&quot;) are
        presented in the following manner:</p>
    <p class="statement">
      <span class="statement-id">Rnnnn</span>Statement
        text here.</p>
    <p>where &quot;nnnn&quot; is replaced by a number that is unique among the
        requirements in 
		  the Profile
		, thereby forming a unique requirement
        identifier.</p>
    <p>Requirement identifiers can be considered to be namespace
        qualified, in such a way as to be compatible with QNames from <a class="offsite" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a>. If
        there is no explicit namespace prefix on a requirement's identifier
        (e.g., &quot;R9999&quot; as opposed to &quot;bp10:R9999&quot;), it should be interpreted
        as being in the namespace identified by the conformance URI of the
        document section it occurs in. If it is qualified, the prefix should
        be interpreted according to the namespace mappings in effect, as
        documented below.</p>
    <p>Some requirements clarify the referenced specification(s), but do not
        place additional constraints upon implementations. For convenience,
        clarifications are annotated in the following manner: <span class="statement-type">C</span></p>
    <p>Some requirements are derived from ongoing standardization work on
        the referenced specification(s). For convenience, such forward-derived
        statements are annotated in the following manner: <span class="statement-origin">xxxx</span>, where &quot;xxxx&quot; is an identifier
        for the specification (e.g., &quot;WSDL20&quot; for WSDL Version 2.0). Note that
        because such work was not complete when this document was published,
        the specification that the requirement is derived from may change;
        this information is included only as a convenience to
        implementers.</p>
    <p>This specification uses a number of namespace prefixes throughout;
            their associated URIs are listed below. Note that the choice of any
            namespace prefix is arbitrary and not semantically significant.</p>

        Profile Identification and Versioning
        </h3>
    <p>This document is identified by a name (in this case, SAML Token Profile) and 
        a version number (here, 1.0). Together, they identify a 
        particular <em>profile instance</em>.</p>
    <p>Version numbers are composed of a major and minor portion, in the form 
        &quot;major.minor&quot;. They can be used to determine the precedence of a 
        profile instance; a higher version number (considering both the major 
        and minor components) indicates that an instance is more recent, and 
        therefore supersedes earlier instances.</p>
    <p>Instances of profiles with the same name (e.g., &quot;Example 
        Profile 1.1&quot; and &quot;Example Profile 5.0&quot;) address interoperability 
        problems in the same general scope (although some developments may 
        require the exact scope of a profile to change between instances).</p>
    <p>One can also use this information to determine whether two instances of 
        a profile are backwards-compatible; that is, whether one can assume 
        that conformance to an earlier profile instance implies conformance to a later 
        one. Profile instances with the same name and major version number (e.g., 
        &quot;Example Profile 1.0&quot; and &quot;Example Profile 1.1&quot;) MAY be considered 
        compatible. Note that this does not imply anything about compatibility 
        in the other direction; that is, one cannot assume that conformance 
        with a later profile instance implies conformance to an earlier one.</p>
    <h2 id="conformance">3 
            Profile Conformance
        </h2>
    <p>Conformance to 
		  the Profile
		 is defined by adherence to the
        set of <em>requirements</em> defined for a specific
        <em>target</em>, within the <em>scope</em> of the
        Profile. This section explains these terms and describes how
        conformance is defined and used.</p>
    <h3 id="conformance_requirements">3.1
             
            Conformance Requirements
        </h3>
    <p>Requirements state the criteria for conformance to the
        Profile. They typically refer to an existing specification and
        embody refinements, amplifications, interpretations and
        clarifications to it in order to improve interoperability. All
        requirements in 
		  the Profile
		 are considered normative, and those
        in the specifications it references that are in-scope (see
        &quot;Conformance Scope&quot;) should likewise be considered normative.
        When requirements in 
		  the Profile
		 and its referenced
        specifications contradict each other, 
		  the Profile
		's
        requirements take precedence for purposes of Profile
        conformance.</p>
    <p>Requirement levels, using <a class="offsite" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</a> language (e.g.,
        MUST, MAY, SHOULD) indicate the nature of the requirement and its
        impact on conformance. Each requirement is individually identified
        (e.g., R9999) for convenience.</p>
    <p>For example;</p>
    <p class="statement">
      <span class="statement-id">R9999</span> WIDGETs SHOULD be round in shape.</p>
    <p>This requirement is identified by &quot;R9999&quot;, applies to the
        target WIDGET (see below), and places a conditional
        requirement upon widgets; i.e., although this requirement must
        be met to maintain conformance in most cases, there are some
        situations where there may be valid reasons for it not being
        met (which are explained in the requirement itself, or in its
        accompanying text).</p>
    <p>Each requirement statement contains exactly one requirement level
        keyword (e.g., &quot;MUST&quot;) and one conformance target keyword (e.g.,
        &quot;MESSAGE&quot;). The conformance target keyword appears in bold text (e.g. &quot;<b>MESSAGE</b>&quot;). Other conformance targets appearing in non-bold text are being used strictly for their definition and NOT as a conformance target. Additional text may
        be included to illuminate a requirement or group of
        requirements (e.g., rationale and examples); however, prose
        surrounding requirement statements must not be considered in
        determining conformance.</p>
    <p>Definitions of terms in 
		  the Profile
		 are considered
        authoritative for the purposes of determining
        conformance.</p>
    <p>None of the requirements in 
		  the Profile
		, regardless of
        their conformance level, should be interpreted as limiting the
        ability of an otherwise conforming implementation to apply
        security countermeasures in response to a real or perceived
        threat (e.g., a denial of service attack).</p>
    <h3 id="conformance_targets">3.2
             
            Conformance Targets
	    </h3>
    <p>Conformance targets identify what artifacts (e.g.,
        SOAP message, WSDL description, UDDI registry data) or
        parties (e.g., SOAP processor, end user) requirements
        apply to. </p>
    <p>This allows for the definition of conformance in
        different contexts, to assure unambiguous interpretation
        of the applicability of requirements, and to allow
        conformance testing of artifacts (e.g., SOAP messages and
        WSDL descriptions) and the behavior of various parties to
        a Web service (e.g., clients and service instances).</p>
    <p>Requirements' conformance targets are physical
        artifacts wherever possible, to simplify testing and avoid
        ambiguity.</p>
    <p>The following conformance targets are used in 
		  the Profile
		:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>SECURE_ENVELOPE</strong> 
              - a SOAP envelope that contains sub-elements that have been subject to integrity and/or confidentiality protection.
		A message is considered conformant when all of its contained Artifacts are conformant with all Statements Targeted to those
		Artifacts as appropriate in the Basic Security Profile.
		Use of artifacts for which there are no statements in the Basic Security Profile does not affect conformance.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>SECURE_MESSAGE</strong> 
              - protocol elements that have WSS Security applied to them. Protocol elements include a primary SOAP envelope and
		optionally associated SwA attachments.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>SENDER</strong> 
              - software that generates a message according to the protocol(s) associated with it. A sender is considered conformant
		when all of the messages it produces are conformant and its behavior is conformant with all statements related to SENDER in the
		Basic Security Profile 1.0.
                (from 
                Basic Profile 1.0)
              </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RECEIVER</strong> 
              - software that consumes a message according to the protocol(s) associated with it. A receiver is considered conformant
		when it is capable of consuming conformant messages containing the artifacts that it supports and its behavior is conformant with
		all statements related to RECEIVER in the Basic Security Profile 1.0. A conformant receiver need not accept all possible conformant
		messages. A conformant receiver may choose not to support artifacts that provide unneeded or undesired functionality. When a receiver
		supports a specific artifact, and the Basic Security Profile 1.0 contains statements related to that artifact, a conformant receiver
		must accept all required conformant forms of that artifact.

            Conformance Scope
        </h3>
    <p>The scope of 
		  the Profile
		 delineates the technologies
        that it addresses; in other words, 
		  the Profile
		 only attempts
        to improve interoperability within its own scope.
        Generally, 
		  the Profile
		's scope is bounded by the
        specifications referenced by it.</p>
    <p>The Profile's scope is further refined by extensibility
        points. Referenced specifications often provide extension
        mechanisms and unspecified or open-ended configuration
        parameters; when identified in 
		  the Profile
		 as an
        extensibility point, such a mechanism or parameter is
        outside the scope of 
		  the Profile
		, and its use or non-use
        is not relevant to conformance.</p>
    <p>Note that 
		  the Profile
		 may still place requirements on
        the use of an extensibility point. Also, specific uses of
        extensibility points may be further restricted by other
        profiles, to improve interoperability when used in
        conjunction with 
		  the Profile
		.</p>
    <p>Because the use of extensibility points may impair
        interoperability, their use should be negotiated or
        documented in some fashion by the parties to a Web
        service; for example, this could take the form of an
        out-of-band agreement.</p>
    <p>The Profile's scope is defined by the referenced
        specifications in <a href="#references">Appendix A</a>,  as refined by the
        extensibility points in <a href="#points">Appendix B</a>.</p>

            In addition a reference to another SAML assertion is also ruled out,
            this is undesirable as SAML does not have a transative trust model.
