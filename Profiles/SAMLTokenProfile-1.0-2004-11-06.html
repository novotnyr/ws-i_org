<H2 id=introduction>1. Introduction</H2>
<P>This document defines the WS-I SAML Token Profile 1.0 (hereafter, &quot;Profile&quot;), 
consisting of a non-proprietary Web services specification, along with 
clarifications to and amplifications of that specification which promote 
interoperability.</P>
<P>Section 1 introduces the Profile.</P>
<P>Section 2, &quot;Scope of the Profile,&quot; delimits the areas where the Profile 
improves interoperability.</P>
<P>Section 3, &quot;Profile Conformance,&quot; explains what it means to be conformant to 
the Profile. </P>
<P>Each subsequent section addresses a component of the Profile, and consists of 
two parts; an overview detailing the component specifications and their 
extensibility points, followed by subsections that address individual parts of 
the component specifications. Note that there is no relationship between the 
section numbers in this document and those in the referenced specifications.</P>
<H3 id=relationship>1.1 Relationship to other Profiles</H3>
<P>This Profile adds an additional security token type for use with Basic 
Security Profile 1.0.</P>
<H3 id=conventions>1.2 Notational Conventions</H3>
<P>Extensibility points in underlying specifications (see &quot;Conformance Scope&quot;) 
are presented in a similar manner:</P>
<P class=statement><SPAN class=statement-id>Ennnn</SPAN> Extensibility Point 
Name - Description. </P>
<P>Non-normative security considerations are presented in a similar manner:</P>
<P class=statement><SPAN class=statement-id>Cnnnn</SPAN> Statement text here. 
</P>
<P>Some statements clarify the referenced specification(s), but do not place 
additional constraints upon implementations. For convenience, clarifications are 
annotated by a superscript letter 'c' on a blue background: <SPAN 
class=statement-type>C</SPAN></P>
<H2 id=scope>2. Scope of the Profile</H2>
<P>The <EM>scope</EM> of the Profile delineates the technologies that it 
addresses; in other words, the Profile only attempts to improve interoperability 
within its own scope. Initially, the Profile's scope is bounded by the 
specifications referenced by it; for a complete list of the Profile's referenced 
specifications, see Appendix I.</P>
<P>The Profile's scope is further refined by <EM>extensibility points</EM>. 
Referenced specifications often provide extension mechanisms and unspecified or 
open-ended configuration parameters. When identified as an extensibility point, 
such a mechanism or parameter is outside the scope of the Profile, and its use 
is not subject to claims of conformance to this Profile.</P>
<P>Because the use of extensibility points may impair interoperability, their 
use should be negotiated or documented in some fashion by the parties to a Web 
service. For example, this could take the form of an out-of-band agreement.</P>
<P>Note that the Profile may still place requirements on the use of an 
extensibility point, without constraining its range. Also, specific uses of 
extensibility points may be further restricted by other profiles, to improve 
their interoperability when used in conjunction with the Profile.</P>
<P>For a complete list of the Profile's extensibility points, see Appendix 
II.</P>
<H3 id=conventions>2.1 Notational Conventions </H3>
<P>The keywords &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, 
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in <A class=offsite 
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</A>.</P>
<P>Normative statements of requirements in the Profile (i.e., those impacting 
conformance, as outlined in &quot;<A 
href="http://members.ws-i.org/dman/Document.phx?documentId=cp31404145926718#conformance_requirements">Conformance 
Requirements</A>&quot;) are presented in the following manner:</P>
<P class=statement><SPAN class=statement-id>Rnnnn</SPAN>Statement text here.</P>
<P>where &quot;nnnn&quot; is replaced by a number that is unique among the requirements in 
the Profile, thereby forming a unique requirement identifier.</P>
<P>Requirement identifiers can be considered to be namespace qualified, in such 
a way as to be compatible with QNames from <A class=offsite 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</A>. If there is no 
explicit namespace prefix on a requirement's identifier (e.g., &quot;R9999&quot; as 
opposed to &quot;bp10:R9999&quot;), it should be interpreted as being in the namespace 
identified by the conformance URI of the document section it occurs in. If it is 
qualified, the prefix should be interpreted according to the namespace mappings 
in effect, as documented below.</P>
<P>Some requirements clarify the referenced specification(s), but do not place 
additional constraints upon implementations. For convenience, clarifications are 
annotated in the following manner: <SPAN class=statement-type>C</SPAN></P>
<P>Some requirements are derived from ongoing standardization work on the 
referenced specification(s). For convenience, such forward-derived statements 
are annotated in the following manner: <SPAN class=statement-origin>xxxx</SPAN>, 
where &quot;xxxx&quot; is an identifier for the specification (e.g., &quot;WSDL20&quot; for WSDL 
Version 2.0). Note that because such work was not complete when this document 
was publiished, the specification that the requirement is derived from may 
change; this information is included only as a convenience to implementers.</P>
<P>This specification uses a number of namespace prefixes throughout; their 
associated URIs are listed below. Note that the choice of any namespace prefix 
is arbitrary and not semantically significant.</P>

  </LI></UL>
<H3 id=versioning>2.2 Profile Identification and Versioning </H3>
<P>This document is identified by a name (in this case, SAML Token Profile) and 
a version number (here, 1.0). Together, they identify a particular <EM>profile 
instance</EM>.</P>
<P>Version numbers are composed of a major and minor portion, in the form 
&quot;major.minor&quot;. They can be used to determine the precedence of a profile 
instance; a higher version number (considering both the major and minor 
components) indicates that an instance is more recent, and therefore supersedes 
earlier instances.</P>
<P>Instances of profiles with the same name (e.g., &quot;Example Profile 1.1&quot; and 
&quot;Example Profile 5.0&quot;) address interoperability problems in the same general 
scope (although some developments may require the exact scope of a profile to 
change between instances).</P>
<P>One can also use this information to determine whether two instances of a 
profile are backwards-compatible; that is, whether one can assume that 
conformance to an earlier profile instance implies conformance to a later one. 
Profile instances with the same name and major version number (e.g., &quot;Example 
Profile 1.0&quot; and &quot;Example Profile 1.1&quot;) MAY be considered compatible. Note that 
this does not imply anything about compatibility in the other direction; that 
is, one cannot assume that conformance with a later profile instance implies 
conformance to an earlier one.</P>
<H2 id=conformance>3 Profile Conformance </H2>
<P>Conformance to the Profile is defined by adherence to the set of 
<EM>requirements</EM> defined for a specific <EM>target</EM>, within the 
<EM>scope</EM> of the Profile. This section explains these terms and describes 
how conformance is defined and used.</P>
<H3 id=conformance_requirements>3.1 Conformance Requirements </H3>
<P>Requirements state the criteria for conformance to the Profile. They 
typically refer to an existing specification and embody refinements, 
amplifications, interpretations and clarifications to it in order to improve 
interoperability. All requirements in the Profile are considered normative, and 
those in the specifications it references that are in-scope (see &quot;Conformance 
Scope&quot;) should likewise be considered normative. When requirements in the 
Profile and its referenced specifications contradict each other, the Profile's 
requirements take precedence for purposes of Profile conformance.</P>
<P>Requirement levels, using <A class=offsite 
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC2119</A> language (e.g., MUST, 
MAY, SHOULD) indicate the nature of the requirement and its impact on 
conformance. Each requirement is individually identified (e.g., R9999) for 
convenience.</P>
<P>For example;</P>
<P class=statement><SPAN class=statement-id>R9999</SPAN> WIDGETs SHOULD be round 
in shape.</P>
<P>This requirement is identified by &quot;R9999&quot;, applies to the target WIDGET (see 
below), and places a conditional requirement upon widgets; i.e., although this 
requirement must be met to maintain conformance in most cases, there are some 
situations where there may be valid reasons for it not being met (which are 
explained in the requirement itself, or in its accompanying text).</P>
<P>Each requirement statement contains exactly one requirement level keyword 
(e.g., &quot;MUST&quot;) and one conformance target keyword (e.g., &quot;MESSAGE&quot;). Additional 
text may be included to illuminate a requirement or group of requirements (e.g., 
rationale and examples); however, prose surrounding requirement statements must 
not be considered in determining conformance.</P>
<P>Definitions of terms in the Profile are considered authoritative for the 
purposes of determining conformance.</P>
<P>None of the requirements in the Profile, regardless of their conformance 
level, should be interpreted as limiting the ability of an otherwise conforming 
implementation to apply security countermeasures in response to a real or 
perceived threat (e.g., a denial of service attack).</P>
<H3 id=conformance_targets>3.2 Conformance Targets </H3>
<P>Conformance targets identify what artifacts (e.g., SOAP message, WSDL 
description, UDDI registry data) or parties (e.g., SOAP processor, end user) 
requirements apply to.</P>
<P>This allows for the definition of conformance in different contexts, to 
assure unambiguous interpretation of the applicability of requirements, and to 
allow conformance testing of artifacts (e.g., SOAP messages and WSDL 
descriptions) and the behavior of various parties to a Web service (e.g., 
clients and service instances).</P>
<P>Requirements' conformance targets are physical artifacts wherever possible, 
to simplify testing and avoid ambiguity.</P>
<P>The following conformance targets are used in the Profile:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>SECURE_ENVELOPE</STRONG> - a SOAP envelope that has been subject 
  to integrity and/or confidentiality protection. A message is considered 
  conformant when all of its contained Artifacts are conformant with all 
  Statements related to SECURE_ENVELOPE or SECURE_MESSAGE as appropriate in the 
  Profile. Use of artifacts for which there are no statements in the Profile 
  does not effect conformance. (from Basic Security Profile 1.0) 
  <LI><STRONG>SECURE_MESSAGE</STRONG> - protocol elements that transport a 
  message that have been subject to integrity and/or confidentiality protection. 
  (from Basic Security Profile 1.0) 
  <LI><STRONG>SENDER</STRONG> - software that generates a message according to 
  the protocol(s) associated with it. A sender is considered conformant when all 
  of the messages it produces are conformant and its behavior is conformant with 
  all statements related to SENDER in the Profile. (from Basic Security Profile 
  1.0) 
  <LI><STRONG>RECEIVER</STRONG> - software that consumes a message according to 
  the protocol(s) associated with it. A receiver is considered conformant when 
  it is capable of consuming conformant messages containing the artifacts that 
  it supports and its behavior is conformant with all statements related to 
  RECEIVER in the Profile. A conformant receiver need not accept all possible 
  conformant messages. A conformant receiver may choose not to support artifacts 
  that provide unneeded or undesired functionality. When a receiver supports a 
  specific artifact, and the Profile contains statements related to that 
  artifact, a conformant receiver must accept all required conformant forms of 
  that artifact. (from Basic Security Profile 1.0) </LI></UL>
<H3 id=conformance_scope>3.3 Conformance Scope </H3>
<P>The scope of the Profile delineates the technologies that it addresses; in 
other words, the Profile only attempts to improve interoperability within its 
own scope. Generally, the Profile's scope is bounded by the specifications 
referenced by it.</P>
<P>The Profile's scope is further refined by extensibility points. Referenced 
specifications often provide extension mechanisms and unspecified or open-ended 
configuration parameters; when identified in the Profile as an extensibility 
point, such a mechanism or parameter is outside the scope of the Profile, and 
its use or non-use is not relevant to conformance.</P>
<P>Note that the Profile may still place requirements on the use of an 
extensibility point. Also, specific uses of extensibility points may be further 
restricted by other profiles, to improve interoperability when used in 
conjunction with the Profile.</P>
<P>Because the use of extensibility points may impair interoperability, their 
use should be negotiated or documented in some fashion by the parties to a Web 
service; for example, this could take the form of an out-of-band agreement.</P>
<P>The Profile's scope is defined by the referenced specifications in <A

A</A>, as refined by the extensibility points in <A
